Conversion from premitive basic to class type

Implicit Type Conversion: Also known as â€˜automatic type conversion.
Done by the compiler on its own, without any external trigger from the user.

Explicit Type Conversion: This process is also called type casting and it is user-defined. Here the user can typecast the result to make it of a particular data type.
